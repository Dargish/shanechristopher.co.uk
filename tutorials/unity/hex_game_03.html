				<p>This will be a pretty quick update that will change our camera from directly setting it's position to using a velocity
				to create a smoother movement and zoom. To achieve this we must add some new variables to our CameraController class.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
	public float MovementSpeed = 0.25f;
	public float ZoomSpeed = 2.0f;
	public float ClosestZoom = 1.0f;
	public float FurthestZoom = 8.0f;
	public float Dampening = 0.7f;
	public float MaxSpeed = 0.5f;

	Vector3 m_velocity;

</code></pre>
			
				<p>We've added Dampening, MaxSpeed and a private velocity variable. The dampening will control how quickly how velocity drains
				off and the camera comes to a stop after the last movement input. The max speed does exactly what you think, it will stop the
				velocity from getting too high if the user just holds down a movement input. The velocity is stored as a Vector3 which we can
				simply add to our position later. First let's have a look at the changes to the Update function</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">	
	void Update ()
	{
		float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
		float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
		float zoom = -Input.GetAxis("Mouse ScrollWheel");
		m_velocity.x += horizontal * MovementSpeed;
		m_velocity.z += vertical * MovementSpeed;
		m_velocity.y += zoom * ZoomSpeed;
		m_velocity.x = Mathf.Max (-MaxSpeed, Mathf.Min (m_velocity.x, MaxSpeed));
		m_velocity.z = Mathf.Max (-MaxSpeed, Mathf.Min (m_velocity.z, MaxSpeed));
		m_velocity.y = Mathf.Max (-MaxSpeed, Mathf.Min (m_velocity.y, MaxSpeed));
	}

</code></pre>

				<p>The first thing you'll notice is that we're no longer changing our position in the Update function. Instead we will update
				the position in <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html">FixedUpdate</a>. FixedUpdate
				is called after a fixed amount of time has elapsed whereas 
				<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Update.html">Update</a> is called when a frame is rendered. This
				can mean that if the frame rate is low that FixedUpdate gets called several times between. Conversely if the frame rate is high
				the scene may be rendered several times between each FixedUpdate call. For a physics simulation it makes more sense to keep the
				user input in the Update function and the physics calculatins in the FixedUpdate function. This is what we'll be doing here.</p>

				<p>Back to the code in our Update function though, we are still collecting vertical, horizontal and zoom inputs as before by
				querying the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html">Input.GetAxis</a> function. Now however
				instead of just adding this to our position we are adding the values to our velocity, we also don't need to worry about our
				movement bounds here. We do however want to ensure that our velocity cannot keep growing larger so we limit it to negative or
				position MaxSpeed.</p>

				<p>Now let's look at FixedUpdate where our position will be updated with the velocity that we have derived from the users input</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
	void FixedUpdate()
	{
		Vector3 position = gameObject.transform.position;
		position += m_velocity;
		if (position.y < ClosestZoom)
		{
			position.y = ClosestZoom;
			m_velocity.y = 0.0f;
		}
		if (position.y > FurthestZoom)
		{
			position.y = FurthestZoom;
			m_velocity.y = 0.0f;
		}
		gameObject.transform.position = position;
		m_velocity *= Dampening;
		if (m_velocity.magnitude < 0.01f)
		{
			m_velocity = Vector3.zero;
		}
	}

</code></pre>

				<p>Here we query the current position and add the velocity to it. We then check our movement bounds to ensure that we don't
				zoom too close or too far away. One minor difference is that if we do get too close or too far away we also set the velocity
				to zero.</p>

				<p>After this we apply the dampening to our velocity and check if it gets to a point so low that we can set it to zero. If we
				don't do this check the velocity will keep getting lower and lower but will still very slowly affect our position.</p>

				<p>Let's see how this looks now:</p>

				<video width="820" height="460" loop controls>
					<source src="resources/video_02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>

				<p>Much better, smooth natural movement and zoom. You can tweak the dampening and speed values to achieve the perfect movement
				for you.</p>
